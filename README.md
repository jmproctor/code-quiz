# Code Quiz

## Description

This is a website that provides the user with a quiz of a few code-themed questions. While the quiz is running, there is a dynamic timer in the top corner that also serves as the user's score. When a question is incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the time. Once all of the questions have been answered, the remaining time is the user's score.
